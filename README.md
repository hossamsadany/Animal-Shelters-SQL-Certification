# project Overview
As a data analyst in the animal welfare department. In preparation for next year's budget, the head of department would like to know the total cost to shelter animals, broken down by each animal type and size combination . task is to prepare a table that contains this information.

The total cost to shelter an animal for the year is calculated as the sum of three factors: the size and animal type, the age, and the location.
The base cost of sheltering an animal is based upon its size and type. The costs per animal type and size are contained in the size_costs table. The criteria for classifying size has recently been updated, and so you will need to categorize animals based upon the following table:

Small	Medium	Large
Dog	<= 10 lbs	10 lbs < and <= 30 lbs	30 lbs <
Cat	<= 5 lbs	5 lbs < and <= 7 lbs	7 lbs <
Bird	<= 0.7 lbs	0.7 lbs < and <= 1.1 lbs	1.1 lbs <
